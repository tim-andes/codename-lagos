# Revamp - Codename: Lagos

This is an MVP of a document analysis AI-based research assistant. Originally using AWS Bedrock + Claude3, I've switched to Ollama local models to reduce infrastructure costs and increase reduce complexity.

## To Do
- [X] Replace AWS Bedrock with Ollama Llama3.2 (or :vision) FM
- [ ] Integrate PDF to Image module
- [ ] Set up LLM to ingest more than one image at a time
